# MicroControler Unit source code

This repo contains source code for Micro Controler Units.  The little boards on the mech that input vision, and ultrasonics and control the servos that move the mech.
 
# Rest of mech-toolkit:
- [mechlib](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mechlib) - a small python libary for autonomously controling mech's.  This integrates networking, vision, and motion control to control the mech.
- [pretrained](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/pretrained) - The releases of pre-trained AI models for mechs.
- [platforms](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/platforms) - The mechanical and electrical documentation for mechs.
